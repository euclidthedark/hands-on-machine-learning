    "\n",
    "**Spam Filter Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples that the system uses to learn are called the *training set*. Each training example is called a *training instance (or sample)*. In this case, the *task T* is to flag spam for new emails, the *experience E* is the training data, and the *performance measure P* needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called *accuracy*, and it is often used in classification tasks. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "One of central arguments for machine learning is scalability. It would be very hard to scale a spam filter using deterministic means, in contrast to statistical methods. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "With machine learning, we can create ML pipelines as data becomes more granular, and the data set grows. In essense, you can scale machine learning solutions in CI/CD manner by creating a continuous feed back loop. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Also, *Data Mining* is a machine learning technique that creates insight and discovery in large ammounts of data. In other words, a program that helps humans see correlations and patterns that otherwise would not be discovered. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "To summarize, Machine Learning is great for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solution: the best Machine Learning techniques can perhaps find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data. \n",

    "### Types of Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many different types of learning systems that it is useful to classify them broadly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Supervised*\n",
    "In a supervised learning system, the training set you feed to the system includes the **Desired Solution**, known as **labels**. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The typical supervised learning tasks are *Classification Problems* and *Numeric Prediction* using *Targets*. Numerical target prediction is acheived when the alorithm is given *Features*, such as (mileage, age, brand, etc.) called *predictors*. This is called *regression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "*In Machine Learning an attribute is a data type (e.g., “mileage”), while a feature has several meanings, depending on the context, but generally means an attribute plus its value (e.g., “mileage = 15,000”). Many people use the words attribute and feature interchangeably.*\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Notable Supervised Systems\n",

    "* Neural networks\n",

    "##### *Unsupervised*\n",
    "\n",
    "In an unsupervised learning system, the training data is **unlabled**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notable Supervised Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clustering\n",
    "    - K-Means\n",

    "\n",
    "*Feature Extraction -* the process of merging correlated features to simplify the prediction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Anomoly Detection -* can be used to remove outliers to help remove unneccesary data from a training set.\n",
    "\n",

    "*Novelty Detection -* can be used to identify \"unique training instances\" when fed into a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Association Rule Learning -* Can be used to find correlations between data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Semisupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms that are efficient at performing tasks when *traning data* sets are partially labled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ex.** Some photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos, are good examples of this. Once you upload all your family photos to the service, it automatically recognizes that the same person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while another person B shows up in photos 2, 5, and 7. This is the unsupervised part of the algorithm (clustering). Now all the system needs is for you to tell it who these people are. Just add one label for the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, the learning system, an *agent*, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and recieve *rewards* or *penalties*. The agent must then learn a *policy*, or optimal strategy to perfrom the task. A *policy*\n",
    "defines what an *agent* should do in a certain environmental condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Batch Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "A system that cannot learn incrementally. In other words, it must be trained with all of the avalible data. This requires a lot of data, so it is typically done *offline*. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Today, it is much easier to incorporate updated, full datasets in machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Online Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems that can learn incrementally by feeding it data sequentially, either individually, or in small groups *mini-batches*. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "These systems are great for programs that have a continous flow of data (i.e. stock data), and need to change rapidly or autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "An important parameter in online learning is the *learning rate*. If you set the learning rate high, then your system will learn with new data quickly, but it will forget the old data. Conversely, if you set it low, it will learn at a slower pace, but it will be less sensitive to noise and *outliers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Instance Based Learning vs. Model Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to classify machine learning is how they *generalize*, or make preditions about new data coming in as inputs. Having a performance measure on the training data is all well and good, but the ultimate goal is in generalizing new data instances coming in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Instance Based Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The system learns the examples by heart, then generalizes to new cases by using a similarity measure to compare them to the learned examples (or a subset of them).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model-based Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to generalize from a set of examples is to build a model of these examples and then use that model to make *predictions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing how well your model describes the data, using a *performance measure*, you can either use a *utility function*, or *fitness function*, that measures how *well* your model performs, or you can define a *cost function*. A *cost function* measures how poorly your model performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training** is using *utility functions*, and/or *cost functions* to optimize your models for prediction.\n"

If you have a data set that is large, the sampling methods used for the data sets, if not done properly, can create `sampling bias`."

    "Perhaps the most famous example of sampling bias happened during the US presidential election in 1936, which pitted Landon against Roosevelt: the Literary Digest conducted a very large poll, sending mail to about 10 million people. It got 2.4 million answers, and predicted with high confidence that Landon would get 57% of the votes. Instead, Roosevelt won with 62% of the votes. The flaw was in the Literary Digest’s sampling method: \n",
    "\n",
    "* First, to obtain the addresses to send the polls to, the Literary Digest used telephone directories, lists of magazine subscribers, club membership lists, and the like. All of these lists tended to favor wealthier people, who were more likely to vote Republican (hence Landon).\n",

    "* Second, less than 25% of the people who were polled answered. Again this introduced a sampling bias, by potentially ruling out people who didn’t care much about politics, people who didn’t like the\n",
